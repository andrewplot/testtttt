development stages:
    fix banner plane DONE 
    delay wave manager to be after banner plane
    fix radar
    place towers anywhere
    design towers
    work on balancing
    add tower upgrades




    




tower types: 
    regular -> -> +range -> +penetration
    splash -> +splash
    camo/lead targetting

enemy types:
    regular red
    fast white that splits into reds
    higher health blues
    lead
    moab that ignores path

maps:
    some kind of water that requires building rafts for towers?
    another stage, one easy one hard

other:
    ability to place towers anywhere
    some kind of ability
    flash house from yellow to red on each hit of damage
    NIGHT TIME WITH LIGHTS?? TREES CAST SHADOWS

questions: does programming complexity help with spark? like ray casting or double buffering
this is the project description: i am working on a project: it is a rp2350b microcontroller project for a tower defense game with four peripherals: a 32x64 LED matrix as the main display, RFID tags for selection, an RFID reader to read it, a controller of some kind for inputs, and a small LCD display to display miscellaneous info like balance. It is for a tower defense game. The game is played on the main display, and is a single map/path for enemies to go across. to simplify the coding, i think its best to have a few preset tower placement squares, and maybe like two enemies types. its based off bloonds td. there will be maybe three tower types. you can select the tower types by scanning an rfid tag associated with that tower to select it, and on the LCD display you can see points and money or something along those lines.
